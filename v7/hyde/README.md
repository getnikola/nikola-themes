This theme is a port of the [Hyde theme by mdo](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) Everything that's good in it is mdo's fault, everything bad is mine.

It supports one variable set in the config:

```
    GLOBAL_CONTEXT = {
        "hyde_subtheme": "theme-base-08"
    }
```

That changes the color scheme, replace 08 with one of 09, 0a, 0b, 0c, 0d, 0e, 0f.

You can read a tutorial about how to create/port new theme [at Nikola's site](https://getnikola.com/creating-a-theme.html)

(*Note:* The `.sidebar` class was renamed to `.hsidebar` to avoid conflicts with reST.)
