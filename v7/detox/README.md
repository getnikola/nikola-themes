The DETOX Theme is based on Andrew Jenkins's Hugo port of a theme
by Jordan Bowman: https://themes.gohugo.io/detox/

This theme is really clean and feature-free. It doesn't support
tags, navigation links, not even comments. Use it if you want as
a basis for a more featureful custom theme or just as a nice
focus-on-content site.
