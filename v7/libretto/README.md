Sophisticated, simple, and classically styled, Libretto is designed to showcase
your writing prowess! A unique feature of this theme is that it does NOT rely
on any Javascript. It's built using HTML, CSS and a few fonts. Best of all,
the theme is responsive - yes, it works on mobiles and tablets too!!


# Theme Highlights

* Classic looks!
* Navigation links on top-right (for tablet/desktop)
* Blog description at bottom
* Support for custom copyright notices at bottom-left
* Icon links to social sites at bottom-right
* Mobile support! (Looks good on my android phone, at least!)
* No Javascript! (for now..?)

This is my first effort at making a theme and I hope you will enjoy using it!

# Un-supported features

Here is a list of Nikola features (that I'm aware of) which are currently not
supported with this theme,

* 3rd-party comment system  (is it even possible to do this without JS ?)
* Tags

If you want a feature to be supported by this theme, please make a request for
it via the theme's official Github issues tracker,

<https://github.com/note2self-abrahamvarricatt/libretto-theme-for-nikola/issues>

As long as it isn't troublesome, I'll try to add it in.


## Original Inspiration
