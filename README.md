This repo contains the publicly available themes for Nikola (https://getnikola.com/)

To contribute a theme:

* Make sure it works well for you
* Start a branch that puts your theme "foo" in vX/foo
* Run ``scripts/test_themes.py foo`` and see if it complains of anything
* Make sure you have a ``README.md`` (written in markdown) in your theme
* Double check licenses for everyhing in your theme
* Do a PR

After a brief discussion it will be merged and available for everyone :-)
