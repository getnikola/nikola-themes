This theme is mostly equivalent to `bootstrap3`, with the optional
`bootstrap-theme.min.css` file in use.  According to the Bootstrap
developers, it provides a visually enhanced experience, with gradients
(hence the name), resembling Bootstrap 2.x.

(bootswatch IS NOT compatible with this theme.  Attempting to use both
 will lead to a broken, mixed theme in which most things affected by
 bootswatch will be replaced by bootstrap-themeâ€™s creations)
