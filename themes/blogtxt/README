This theme is loosely based on Scott Wallick's nice "blog.txt" theme.
If there is anything nice here, he did it. If there is something wrong
or broken, I (Roberto Alsina <ralsina@netmanagers.com.ar>) did it instead.

I did it basically to see if it was possible to port wordpress themes to Nikola. 
And it is, but it involves reading php files and loosely reinterpreting them
into Mako templates.

At least the CSS files are easily adapted.

This theme is under a LGPL license just like the original (see license.txt), enjoy!
