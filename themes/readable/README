A minimalistic, readable ione column theme, very loosely based on doc: http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/doc 
although it shares no code with it.

Meta links and other things are at the bottom.

This theme is in the public domain. However, it includes code from other authors, which is
under different licenses. Specifically:

This theme happily ignores the SOCIAL_BUTTONS_CODE option and uses Sharrre instead because
it looks pretty.

* jquery.sharrre-1.3.4.min.js is under an MIT license, and is (c) Julien Hany

This theme inherits from the bootstrap theme, so it uses Twitter Bootstrap, JQuery and much more.
