## About the preview images
They are optional and can be added fairly easily.

Simply add `previewimage:` meta tag with the path to the image to the front matter of the post.

E.g.
`.. previewimage: /images/previewimages/how-to-contribute-to-open-source.png`

The optimal width if the image is 770px.
